# Text-summarizer
This is a pdf text summarizer application,it uses extractive text summarization technique.In this project i have first extracted text from pdf using pdfminer file which users select and then i have vectorized sentences using gensim word2vec converter technique. After that i have uses Text Rank Algorithm  where score between each sentence is basically a cosine similarity in this way i am not only extracting random sentences but interconnected sentences so that we can have understandable summary.For the user interface part i have used kivymd at a very basic level.
